# Base Go v0.0.1

## Purpose

Serve as a foundation upon which I can build future Go projects.

## Contributing

First, you must have Go installed at the version specified in `.tool-versions`.
If you have `ag` and `entr` installed, run `make dev`;
this will watch for updates and restart the server.
Otherwise, run `make run` to run the application.

If you find any bugs or have any feedback, please open an issue on GitHub.
Pull requests for fixing a typo or an obvious error are welcome.
However, since this is my base template for future Go projects, please open an issue asking about a change before making it.
